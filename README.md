- Depositor must approve the contract to transfer the fundingAmount. Depositing to the contract kicks off the funding period
- Investors can send the exact amount of USDC they are whitelisted for during the funding period
- When that ends the depositor can withdraw the difference if not all has been invested along with the withdrawalToken
